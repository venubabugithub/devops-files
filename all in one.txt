vpc
typpes of ebs
iops is input output per second 1gb = 3 ips limit 100gb to 3000gb
attch the instance to volume 
we should create ebs in region which instance is created
lsblk to list block(xvdf shows mounted device information)
first format xvdf mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
create one directory mkdir /opt/venu
cd /opt/venu
mount /dev/xvdf
mount /dev/xvdf  /opt/venu
create 30 files
check df -h  if u got /opt/venu or not

if the instance attached to the volume got deleted then create an other intance and attach it
now u can drectly mount by mkdir /opt/raja
                           mount /dev/xvdf  /opt/raja
check u got 30 files or not

difference btween snapshot and mi
snapshot is backup for volumes ami is for whole instance
---------------------------------------------------------(24)
in s3 data is stored in the form of objects
types of storages block nd s3 and types
types of instances
ondemand, spot, reserved instances
on demand instance: no long commitment with amazon u can start or stop anytime
reserved nstance: reserved for 1 to 3 years (ca get 70 percent discount)
spot instace: enables u to request unused instance can get 90 percent discount

s3 simple storage service
we can create 100 buckets default and after u have to request aws

GIT HUB
 
create a 3files in github in main branch
create a feature branch and add 4th file
now merge feature branch with master
             base main branch compare feature branch
raise a pull request
merge pull request (shhould be done by manager)

in linux
install git
crete a drectory called aws
go inside aws directory
clone github project                                         -git clone url
add file5 in main brnch and write it is written in linux(in linux)
check the status of commits                                  -git status
add file5                                                     git add file5
commit the files                                              git commit -m ""

---------------------------------------------(8)
connect to github                                             git remote add origin url
push main branch to github                                    git push -u origin main
git pull=git fetch+git merge
check git status                                              git statu 
create new branch                                             git branch branchname
switch to feature branch                                      git checkout branchname
remove remote connection from github
check connection bw git ng hub is there or not                git remote -v
-------------------------------------------(9)
connect again
delete branch in linux                                       git branch -d branchname(-D when u r deleting future branch whih have more files than master and not merrged)
git pull
when created a branch in central and want to pull to local   git pull origin <branch> --rebase 
-------------------------------------------(10)
create a branch and checkout to that branch                   git checkout -b branchname 
git files are available in all branches unless u commit to a partcular branch
create 2 branches and create 2 files iside each branch and merge them
git merge                                                    git merge src and dest(stay in dest branch)
when u rebase u can see the history logs of rebased branches also
create 2 files and add to git stash-->git stash (if not working git add -A then git stash)
commit files in git statsh   -->git stash apply
check git stash list            git stash list
commit files through pop        git stash pop
difference between git pop and git stash
both are for same purpose but if u apply git pop stash id is not shown in git stash list
delete file are ther in git stash   git stash clear
git reset soft reset hard reset
tag a git branch                    git tag tagname
push the tagged brannch             git push origin tagname
we r tagging so the branch will be created as a zip whenever u want u can download
if we want to connect through ssh we use pem key
